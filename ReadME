DIY NAS Build ‚Äî Repurposing an Old Desktop for Music Production Storage
As a music producer and creative, I generate a ton of data‚Äîproject files, samples, plugins, VST libraries, media, and more. My local machines were getting cluttered fast, and I needed a centralized, scalable, and efficient storage solution that wouldn't break the bank.

Instead of dropping $300+ on a pre-built NAS (without drives), I took a different route: I challenged myself to build a NAS from scratch using an old HP Pavilion desktop from my parents. The goal? A cross-platform file server accessible from both Windows and Linux systems.

üõ†Ô∏è System Specs (Donor Machine)
Model: HP Pavilion p6710f

Motherboard: Pegatron M2N78-LA (Violet6) ‚Äî microATX

CPU: AMD Athlon II X4 635 (95W TDP)

Power Supply (Stock): 250W OEM (Bestec or Delta)

Drive Support: 4 SATA ports

Case: Mid-tower ATX ‚Äî room for standard ATX PSU

üîß Initial To-Do List
Before putting this machine into full-time storage duty, I needed to knock out a few upgrades and checks:

Drive Health Check:
Remove old drives, test for integrity, and replace as needed. Planning to install:

2√ó Seagate 7200RPM SATA drives (for RAID 1 setup)

Cooling + Maintenance:

Add or replace case fans (ARCTIC F12 ‚Äì 120mm standard fan)

Reapply thermal paste to CPU (MX-4 Thermal Compound)

Power Upgrade:

Swap the OEM PSU for a modern, reliable unit:

650W 80+ Bronze Non-Modular ATX PSU

Cabling:

Add SATA III 90-degree locking cables (x2)

Ensure enough SATA power connectors from the PSU

This project is a work in progress. Once complete, I‚Äôll document the OS installation, RAID config, and remote access setup. Stay tuned!
